## This repo
This repo is created to capture the code I write during my adventure into the world of reinforcement learning. In this adventure I'll be following the tracks left by Sutton and Barto in their fantastic book: *Reinforcement Learning, an introduction*

This repo also will be the code behind a Medium series I'm working on, where I summarize these concepts so I, or anyone else interested in the subject, can visit later, refresh his memory, or check something he/she found confusing.

## Code Structure
So far I organized code into two main parts
### Insanity
Bardon the naming, I got bit excited! Is a framework that models the components of RL allowing me to perform experiments in a modular and extensible way. So far it is work in progress but the results are promising.

Idea of *Insanity* is to isolate specifics of experiment, environment...etc form the core logic of RL and to provide a way to supply different learning algorithms, different ways to initialize or select actions...etc

I don't know much yet, so the more I learn the more updates I'll be adding.

### Experiment Code
Specifics about environment, agent, data collected, plotting, analysis...etc

### Caveat
My python experience is very limited. And as I'm going through this work - like it or not - I found python to be an aging language that needs complete rehaul and its community and echo system are the only reason it is still alive! So I may switch to something else if I can find it.
